# Chess-optimal-moves-simulation
Three objectives of code implemented:

i.	Simulating Chess openings: 
The Italian Game, Sicilian Defense, The French Defense, The Ruy-Lopez, The Slav Defense. Simulation involving turn wise moves to give player a demo to learn the best and efficient openings that could optimize their moves and increase win rate during gameplay.

ii.	Chess game involving ai:
Implementing the chess game involving player vs AI. AI moves are decided by implementing the NegaMax algorithm and adding alpha beta pruning. The random moves of each piece satisfying valid moves are made more accurate by utilizing weighted graphs.

iii.	Displaying graph for each piece in chess:
The valid moves for each piece are calculated and positions are described as vertices of a graph where the edge of the graph displays the move transition from one tile to another tile. The Knightâ€™s tour problem coded and transitions to be displayed as a graph
